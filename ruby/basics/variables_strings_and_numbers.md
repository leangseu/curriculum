## Variables
You should know what variables are from the prep course and know how to assign values to a variable name
.

What you may not know are the common Ruby naming conventions for variables and some more advanced assignment operators so we'll cover them here.



### How to make them
- assignment operators =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=

Almost all programming languages use the `=` sign to assign values to variables.

```
num = 5
```
In the above statement, we're assigning the value `5` to the variable `num` using `=`.

- parallel assignment
We can also assign more than one variable in a single statement. Look at the following example.

```
name, age = 'John', 34
```
Here, we're assigning the string `'John'` to the variable `name` and the value 
`34` to the variable `age`

### Different ways to name them
- naming conventions
- description
- code snippets
- further reading(if any)

## Strings
- double and single quotes in strings
-  

### Concatenation
- using the shovel operator or the += method
- concatenating variables

### Interpolation
- using variables inside strings
- using expressions inside strings

### Common string methods
- capitalize
- count
- include?
- upcase
- downcase
- empty?
- length
- reverse
- split
- strip

### Substrings
- slice.. aliased as -> [0..2], [1,3]

### Escape Characters
- \", \'
- \\
- \b
- \r
- \n
- \s
- \t

### String Manipulation
- gsub
- insert
- partition
- prepend

## Numbers
A brief description of the different types of numbers in Ruby and the maths operations you can do on them.

### Common Operators and Expressions
- +-\*
- % ^ **

### Floats and Integers

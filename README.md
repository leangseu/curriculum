# Welcome to The Odin Project Curriculum: [Learn Web Development for Free](http://theodinproject.com)

The Odin Project is an open source community and curriculum for learning what you need to know to be hireable as a web developer. Our curriculum consists of the best curated resources for learning web development on the web. We also have lots of original content throughout the courses and lessons. Each course has multiple projects that allow the students to practice what they have been learning and to use in their portfolio.

This repository houses the curriculum content used by [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com) website.

The Odin project community can be found on our [gitter chat rooms](https://gitter.im/TheOdinProject/theodinproject)
